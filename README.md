Travel during pandemic


### User story

AS a wanderer, 
I WANT to search flight deals, currency exchange rates, groupon deals, and covid information about the travel destination, 
So that I can find the best travel deals and be informed on what is happening at my desired destination.

GIVEN I am accessing the destination search page,
WHEN I enter my start and end destination into the search and desired dates,
THEN I am provided with flight deals, coronavirus information, groupon deals, and exchange rates.
